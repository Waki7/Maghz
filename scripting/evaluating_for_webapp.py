I\'d like a more specific explanation that includes the following information:\n1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border?  \n2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?\n3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary?\n4.

Speakers \nwere invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could \ncross-examine the witnesses.  Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided.  Michael \nKahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated \nin some cross-examination as well.\n\nSpeakers were:\n\nISO:  \nKellan Fluckiger, COO\nAnjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis\nFrank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee\n\nCal PX:\nDavid Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs\nSeth Wilson, \n\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management District:\nCarol Coy, Deputy Executive Director\n\nCPUC:\nHarvey Morris, Principal Attorney\n\nSDG&E:\nDonald Garber\n\nISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the \nwholesale market:\n\n 1.  Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00)\n 2.  Lack of generation additions in entire west\n 3.  Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to \nretain water in spring.\n 4.  Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in \nAugust\n 5.  Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound\n 6.  Increased underscheduling from June-August\n\nISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) \nhave increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total \ncost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 \nin July.  Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be \ninterpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been \ndriven up in lower load hours.  \n\nWhile ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC \nto be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further \nreductions would have on the market.  They conclude that such a reduction \nwould deter new investment,  preclude generators from recovering fixed costs \nof production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower \nimports).\n\nISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the \nfollowing:\n\n1.  File for extension of price cap authority to FERC.\n2.  Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on \ngenerators for a significant portion of their capacity.\n3.  CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and \nhedged by UDCs\n4.  CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs\n5.  Maintain sufficient planning reserves.\n\nISO Staff also stated that:\n\n1.  Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation\n a.  Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load\n b.  Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation\n c.  Additional charge for real-time market transactions\n\n2.  Attract and expedite new resources\n\nMARKET POWER:\n\nWhile the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the \nunderlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was \nPresident Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting \nmarket power.  Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to \ndetermine from the information they have.  Secondly, the analysis they have \ndone show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the \nability (opportunity) to exercise market power.  Therefore, at one point or \nanother, nearly every market participant has market power.\n\nWolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak \nperiods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in \noff-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal \ncosts.\n\nNo further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.",

Michael \nKahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated \nin some cross-examination as well.\n\nSpeakers were:\n\nISO:  \nKellan Fluckiger, COO\nAnjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis\nFrank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee\n\nCal PX:\nDavid Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs\nSeth Wilson, \n\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management District:\nCarol Coy, Deputy Executive Director\n\nCPUC:\nHarvey Morris, Principal Attorney\n\nSDG&E:\nDonald Garber\n\nISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the \nwholesale market:\n\n 1.  Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00)\n 2.  Lack of generation additions in entire west\n 3.  Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to \nretain water in spring.\n 4.  Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in \nAugust\n 5.  Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound\n 6.  Increased underscheduling from June-August\n\nISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) \nhave increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total \ncost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 \nin July.  Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be \ninterpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been \ndriven up in lower load hours.  \n\nWhile ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC \nto be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further \nreductions would have on the market.  They conclude that such a reduction \nwould deter new investment,  preclude generators from recovering fixed costs \nof production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower \nimports).\n\nISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the \nfollowing:\n\n1.  File for extension of price cap authority to FERC.\n2.  Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on \ngenerators for a significant portion of their capacity.\n3.  CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and \nhedged by UDCs\n4.  CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs\n5.  Maintain sufficient planning reserves.\n\nISO Staff also stated that:\n\n1.  Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation\n a.  Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load\n b.  Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation\n c.  Additional charge for real-time market transactions\n\n2.  Attract and expedite new resources\n\nMARKET POWER:\n\nWhile the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the \nunderlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was \nPresident Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting \nmarket power.  Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to \ndetermine from the information they have.  Secondly, the analysis they have \ndone show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the \nability (opportunity) to exercise market power.  Therefore, at one point or \nanother, nearly every market participant has market power.\n\nWolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak \nperiods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in \noff-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal \ncosts.\n\nNo further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.",

Dan McSwain \n? 09/26/2000 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: North County Times - \nEscondido, California Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business \nNews; Source: World Reporter (TM) \n\nAn uneasy aftermath has settled over this summer\'s power price shocks in San \nDiego County, punctuated this weekend by cool weather and falling electricity \nprices, as the state and federal policy-making apparatus shifts from a season \nof panicked damage control to the extremely difficult question of what to do \nnext.\n\nIn the parlance of the electricity industry, these are the "shoulder" months; \na breather between periods of heavy demand for summer cooling and winter \nheating in which power-generating plants are typically pulled out of \ncommission for trouble-shooting, overdue maintenance and refueling. \n\nCalifornia\'s pioneering deregulation of its electricity industry lies in a \nstate of exhaustion. Guarantees from politicians of greater efficiency and \nlower prices have collapsed this summer into chronic power shortages and a \nhistoric transfer of wealth that in about 90 days moved $10.6 billion from \nthe buyers of electricity to the sellers.\n\nOptimism is in short supply as a fractious collection of stakeholders and the \nnation\'s political and regulatory institutions begin to search for solutions.\n\nEmergency legislation approved by state lawmakers in August will temporarily \nreduce bills for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. \nfrom an average $146 in September to about $72 per month. In July 1999, San \nDiego County and parts of south Orange County became the first region in the \nnation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of \nelectricity.\n\nCool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices \ndown from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on \nFriday.\n\nBut while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for \nSDGOcustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost \nof power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. Historically, prices have \nfallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year \nprices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off \nagain in summer 2001.\n\nAnalysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their \nability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher \nand supplies of power are tight in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSDGOsays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the \ncompany, that could run up an $800 million IOU by 2003. In the past, the \nPublic Utilities Commission has allowed the utility to pass on such \nshortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates.\n\nPacific Gas&Electric and Southern California Edison, the state\'s other \ninvestor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this \nsummer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. Both \nutilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk \nof sustained high wholesale prices.\n\nConsumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. Three major credit \nrating companies said the California utilities face increased regulatory \nuncertainty, and the utilities\' stock prices fell last week.\n\nA hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority \nto clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation.\n\nCalifornia regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a \nseries of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices \nand into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies. \nChief among them is an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission that may lead to changes in California\'s power trading system.\n\n"Unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to \nthe federal government," said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California \nPublic Utilities Commission, the state\'s top regulator.\n\nJames Hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said Lynch overstates \nthe case. "California has not given me one scintilla of authority that I \ndidn\'t already have," Hoecker said in August.\n\nThe federal commission has been critical of California\'s approach to \nderegulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale \nmarkets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its \ninvestigative powers.\n\nWhat is dawning on California policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson \nthat deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government \nofficials and to the market participants. The challenge is to get \nderegulation right the first time.\n\n"The problem is not deregulation," said Robert McCullough, an economist and \nformer utility executive based in Portland, Ore. "The problem is this Rube \nGoldberg device that has been constructed in California."\n\nThe trading practices of power marketers in the West also is under scrutiny \nby the federal commission. Regulators informed electricity marketing \ncompanies in August that if price gouging is found, the refund of some \nprofits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned \nafter mid-October.\n\nA surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their \nown interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. Ranging from \nconsumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say \nbungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy \nof generating companies.\n\n"This market has behaved very rationally this summer," said Frank Wolak, a \nStanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of \nCalifornia\'s power transmission manager. "All you need is tight supply to \nexercise market power in this market; you don\'t need collusion."\n\nA titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale \nmarkets on behalf of California consumers. All three utilities have been \ngranted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for \nelectricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies, \nlargely bypassing the state\'s nonprofit power exchange.\n\nIn an equally important development, the manager of most of California\'s \ntransmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign \nlong-term deals for power. Up to now, the transmission manager has been \nlimited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid.\n\nCritics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that \nexisted before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large, \nlong-term deals with a handful of suppliers.\n\nThe architects of California\'s deregulation, fearing the monopoly power of \nthe utilities, had stripped bilateral purchasing authority to foster \ncompetition among a new kind of retail power provider.

In July 1999, San \nDiego County and parts of south Orange County became the first region in the \nnation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of \nelectricity.\n\nCool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices \ndown from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on \nFriday.\n\nBut while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for \nSDGOcustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost \nof power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. Historically, prices have \nfallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year \nprices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off \nagain in summer 2001.\n\nAnalysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their \nability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher \nand supplies of power are tight in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nSDGOsays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the \ncompany, that could run up an $800 million IOU by 2003. In the past, the \nPublic Utilities Commission has allowed the utility to pass on such \nshortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates.\n\nPacific Gas&Electric and Southern California Edison, the state\'s other \ninvestor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this \nsummer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. Both \nutilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk \nof sustained high wholesale prices.\n\nConsumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. Three major credit \nrating companies said the California utilities face increased regulatory \nuncertainty, and the utilities\' stock prices fell last week.\n\nA hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority \nto clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation.\n\nCalifornia regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a \nseries of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices \nand into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies. \nChief among them is an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission that may lead to changes in California\'s power trading system.\n\n"Unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to \nthe federal government," said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California \nPublic Utilities Commission, the state\'s top regulator.\n\nJames Hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said Lynch overstates \nthe case. "California has not given me one scintilla of authority that I \ndidn\'t already have," Hoecker said in August.\n\nThe federal commission has been critical of California\'s approach to \nderegulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale \nmarkets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its \ninvestigative powers.\n\nWhat is dawning on California policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson \nthat deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government \nofficials and to the market participants. The challenge is to get \nderegulation right the first time.\n\n"The problem is not deregulation," said Robert McCullough, an economist and \nformer utility executive based in Portland, Ore. "The problem is this Rube \nGoldberg device that has been constructed in California."\n\nThe trading practices of power marketers in the West also is under scrutiny \nby the federal commission. Regulators informed electricity marketing \ncompanies in August that if price gouging is found, the refund of some \nprofits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned \nafter mid-October.\n\nA surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their \nown interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. Ranging from \nconsumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say \nbungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy \nof generating companies.\n\n"This market has behaved very rationally this summer," said Frank Wolak, a \nStanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of \nCalifornia\'s power transmission manager. "All you need is tight supply to \nexercise market power in this market; you don\'t need collusion."\n\nA titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale \nmarkets on behalf of California consumers. All three utilities have been \ngranted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for \nelectricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies, \nlargely bypassing the state\'s nonprofit power exchange.\n\nIn an equally important development, the manager of most of California\'s \ntransmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign \nlong-term deals for power. Up to now, the transmission manager has been \nlimited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid.\n\nCritics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that \nexisted before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large, \nlong-term deals with a handful of suppliers.\n\nThe architects of California\'s deregulation, fearing the monopoly power of \nthe utilities, had stripped bilateral purchasing authority to foster \ncompetition among a new kind of retail power provider. Under the scheme, \nutilities were to be limited to the highly regulated business of electricity \ndistribution Folder Name: Utilities, Electric: Deregulation Relevance Score \non Scale of 100: \n95______________________________________________________________________ To \nreview or revise your folder, visit Dow Jones CustomClipsor contact Dow Jones \nCustomer  Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.comor by phone at \n800-369-7466.

"This is market \npower in action."\n\nMarket power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market \nparticipants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices.\n\nMany of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed \ntheir belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and \ncontributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has \nreduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. \nMainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal \nagencies, including the EPA.\n\nConventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego \nCounty are scant.\n\nEncina\'s operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG \nEnergy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no \nabnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said \nWednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution \nlimits.\n\nBut David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina \nplant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets.\n\n"That can\'t possibly be right," Lloyd said of McCullough\'s analysis. "In \nNorth County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency \nshutdown because of heavy output).\n\n"Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, \nI can\'t comment," Lloyd said.\n\n"We certainly don\'t want to be accused of anything wrongful," he said. "We \ndon\'t have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in \nCalifornia to push up the price somewhere else doesn\'t make sense for us. We \nwant to run all we can when the prices are high."\n\nElectricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a \ndoubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million \ncustomers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion \nin losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.\n\nState lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with \na retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow \nbeyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist.\n\nNo fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to \nassess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western \nstates. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies \nwhich produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit \nderegulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright \nmanipulation in order to increase profits.\n\nInquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity \nOversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff \ninvestigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they \nare still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data.\n\nMcCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium \nof large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate \nthe price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an \nexhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount \nof electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that \nwas actually used.\n\nChief among McCullough\'s findings was that demand for power was lower this \nsummer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, \na federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web \nof power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western \nstates, British Columbia and northern Mexico.\n\nMcCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North \nCounty Times, and the initial reaction of the state\'s energy community was \none of deep skepticism.\n\n"EPA data is notoriously unreliable," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor \nand the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California \nIndependent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which \nhas paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual \noutput of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data \nfrom the EPA.\n\n"Greed would get the best of anybody," Wolak said. "I found a lot of hours \nwhere in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were \ncranking it out."\n\nWolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, \nhowever, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was \nthe major cause of higher prices this summer.\n\nAt the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize \nMcCullough\'s analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing \nhigher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real \nshortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states.\n\nLow hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures \nin the Southwest were blamed for limiting California\'s ability to import \nelectricity.\n\nOthers said state and federal regulators, along with market participants \nthemselves, won\'t really know what happened until more experts look at hard \nmarket information that is in short supply.\n\nRon Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said \nmarket information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and \nbuyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading \ncompanies.\n\n"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don\'t buy that," \nEachus said.\n\nTim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the \nlargest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the \nunique stand that more information which has been labeled "proprietary" by \ncompanies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is \nselling for, should be made available instantly to the markets.\n\n"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving \nrationally?" Belden said.\n\n"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody \nunderstands," he said. "If you\'ve got nothing to hide, release the data."\n\n\n\n-----\n\nTo see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go \nto http://www.nctimes.com\n\n(c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies \nwhich produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit \nderegulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright \nmanipulation in order to increase profits.\n\nInquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity \nOversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff \ninvestigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they \nare still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data.\n\nMcCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium \nof large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate \nthe price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an \nexhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount \nof electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that \nwas actually used.\n\nChief among McCullough\'s findings was that demand for power was lower this \nsummer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, \na federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web \nof power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western \nstates, British Columbia and northern Mexico.\n\nMcCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North \nCounty Times, and the initial reaction of the state\'s energy community was \none of deep skepticism.\n\n"EPA data is notoriously unreliable," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor \nand the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California \nIndependent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which \nhas paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual \noutput of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data \nfrom the EPA.\n\n"Greed would get the best of anybody," Wolak said. "I found a lot of hours \nwhere in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were \ncranking it out."\n\nWolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, \nhowever, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was \nthe major cause of higher prices this summer.\n\nAt the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize \nMcCullough\'s analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing \nhigher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real \nshortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states.\n\nLow hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures \nin the Southwest were blamed for limiting California\'s ability to import \nelectricity.\n\nOthers said state and federal regulators, along with market participants \nthemselves, won\'t really know what happened until more experts look at hard \nmarket information that is in short supply.\n\nRon Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said \nmarket information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and \nbuyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading \ncompanies.\n\n"If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don\'t buy that," \nEachus said.\n\nTim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the \nlargest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the \nunique stand that more information which has been labeled "proprietary" by \ncompanies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is \nselling for, should be made available instantly to the markets.\n\n"Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving \nrationally?" Belden said.\n\n"California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody \nunderstands," he said. "If you\'ve got nothing to hide, release the data."\n\n\n\n-----\n\nTo see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go \nto http://www.nctimes.com\n\n(c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

            SampleType.BODY.value: 'California Officials Investigate Electric \'Megawatt Laundering\'\nSteve Johnson , San Jose Mercury News, Calif.\n\n( October 31, 2000 )\n\n\n\nOct. 30--While investigating this summer\'s stunning spike in electricity \nprices, state authorities have heard stories about a curious phenomenon:\n\nOn days when the weather is hot, batches of power generated in California are \nsold to other states. A little later in the day, similar amounts of power are \nsold back to California -- but at much higher prices.\n\nThe question is, is it the same power? If so, that could be "megawatt \nlaundering" -- a multi-company conspiracy to evade California\'s wholesale \nprice cap, which covers power generated in California but not power sold into \nCalifornia from elsewhere.\n\nWorried that such transactions could be costing consumers millions of \ndollars, several energy specialists raised concerns about megawatt laundering \nduring a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearing a month ago in San \nDiego. And earlier this month, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-La Mesa -- who \nhelped lead the push to deregulate electricity sales in California -- \nformally asked the commission to investigate the practice, which he termed \n"potentially illegal market coordination."\n\nBut an unconfirmed news report last week said the federal agency had \nconcluded that generators had not abused the market. And others say concerns \nabout megawatt laundering are exaggerated.\n\nAmong them is Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy \nProducers Association, a power-firm trade group, and chairman of the \nIndependent System Operator, which oversees most of California\'s power grid.\n\nWhile acknowledging that such laundering is possible, Smutny-Jones said there \nis no evidence it is actually occurring or is widespread.\n\n"This is one of those things that\'s turning into an urban legend," he said. \n"I don\'t want to characterize this as a significant problem."\n\nEven some critics of the way power is purchased in California concede that \nmost of what has been labeled megawatt laundering probably reflects nothing \nmore sinister than the ability of some entrepreneurs to take advantage of a \ngood deal when they see one.\n\nNonetheless, they see evidence that at least some California-produced power \nis being sold out of and back into the state at a higher price. And they \nblame that on loopholes in the system that they say ought to be closed \nbecause the transactions are helping to drive up the cost of power.\n\nThe Independent System Operator "invites this type of activity," said Frank \nWolak, a Stanford economist who chairs the non-profit corporation\'s market \nsurveillance committee, which has warned of the potential for megawatt \nlaundering in at least two reports this year. "The thing that makes all these \nproblems go is the fact that the ISO has said, `We\'ll pay whatever it takes \nto keep the lights on,\' and that\'s screwing consumers big time."\n\nIn 1998, when the state\'s energy markets were deregulated, it was generally \nassumed that opening up the sale of electricity to competition would make \npower less expensive. As a precaution, however, officials at the Independent \nSystem Operator instituted wholesale price caps, which they lowered twice \nthis summer to help keep a lid on costs. On July 1 this year, they reduced \nthe cap from $750 per megawatt per hour to $500, one megawatt being \nsufficient power for 1,000 homes. Then, on Aug. 7, they cut it to $250.\n\nUnfortunately, things haven\'t worked out the way officials had hoped. \nWholesale prices rose dramatically this year. And while a freeze on retail \nutility rates has temporarily shielded Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers \nfrom those soaring costs, home electricity prices have tripled in San Diego, \nwhere a similar freeze already has come off.\n\nIn the process, some generators learned that all it takes to get around the \nstate\'s wholesale price caps is a basic understanding of how the market \nworks. One of the best ways to get top dollar, they learned, was to hold off \nselling their electricity until the Independent System Operator issues what \nis known as an out-of-market call for energy, which amounts to an emergency \nrequest for electricity.\n\nFrom May through September this year, the overall price of power in the state \naveraged less than $125 per megawatt hour, according to authorities. But over \nthe same period, power sold in response to out-of-market calls averaged more \nthan $430.\n\nDuring the summer, when energy use is at a maximum, California typically \nimports about one-fourth of the power it uses from other states. Since power \ngenerated by firms in other states isn\'t limited by California\'s price cap, \nthose companies generally are in a better position than California firms to \nmake a killing on out-of-market sales. But by cutting a deal with a \ncollaborator in another state, energy specialists say, California generators \nalso can profit handsomely -- despite the cap.\n\nHere\'s how:\n\nSay a California generator has 100 megawatts. Instead of selling it in \nCalifornia, where the firm can receive no more than $250 per megawatt hour \nunder the current cap, it finds a utility, an electricity broker or a \ncorporate affiliate with an equal amount of power in another state, such as \nArizona. Then -- just before an expected heat wave in California, which is \nlikely to result in an out-of-market call for power here -- it convinces the \nother firm to do a trade.\n\nUnder the deal, the California generator sends its 100 megawatts for one hour \nto the company in Arizona, where there is no price cap, and earns $300 or \nmore per megawatt -- for a total of $300,000. In return, the Arizona firm \nships its 100 megawatts for one hour here. Since that power isn\'t subject to \nCalifornia\'s cap, it earns perhaps $400 per megawatt -- for a total of \n$400,000.\n\nPresumably, energy specialists say, the two firms then split the $100,000 \ndifference.\n\nThe potential profit from such deals is considerable. Generators in and out \nof California received more than $110 million from out-of-market sales this \nsummer, according to the Independent System Operator. But determining if \nmegawatt laundering is really happening, how often and who might be \nbenefiting, is difficult.\n\nOne California investigator said authorities first suspected that megawatt \nlaundering was occurring when they noticed that precisely the same amount of \npower was being sold to another state and then sold back into California \nminutes later. But other experts said the evidence has rarely been that \nclear. While hundreds of megawatts is sold into and out of the state on any \ngiven day, they said, the suspicion that firms were conspiring to sell the \nsame power back and forth has stemmed largely from unfounded speculation.\n\nOne big problem for investigators trying to learn if the system has been \nabused is that confidentiality rules keep many of the details about these \nelectricity transactions private.\n\n"Entities like us and others who may be suffering from the consequences of \nthis laundering don\'t necessarily have the documents" to prove it, said Gary \nStern, director of market monitoring for Southern California Edison, one of \nthe state\'s three main utilities. "We can only speculate based on things \nwe\'ve heard from others about the practice....It\'s our hope that\'s one of the \nthings that\'s being examined" by the various federal and state agencies \ninvestigating this summer\'s extraordinary rise in California power prices.\n\nIndeed, while some people say megawatt laundering can be substantially \nlimited by ending the practice of paying more than the wholesale cap for \nout-of-state power, others argue that it\'s just as important to eliminate the \nsecrecy surrounding electricity transactions.\n\n"I\'d like to see more information" made public, said Jim Bushnell, a \nresearcher at the University of California Energy Institute in Berkeley, who \nspecializes in analyzing the state\'s energy markets. "There are a lot of \nrumors circulating around this," he said of megawatt laundering, "and it \nwould help clarify if this is a serious problem."\n\n\n\n-----\n\nTo see more of the San Jose Mercury News, or to subscribe to the newspaper, \ngo to http://www.sjmercury.com',

Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the \n"authors" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies \nto advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing \ncourse.

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen \n489\npercent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent \njump\nin Chicago.\n\n??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co.\nsubsidiary, for an explanation.\n\n??"The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to \nconstraints\non the pipeline and demand?" Steinberg asked.\n\n??"Yes," Eads replied. Eads said the state\'s energy crisis, which led power\nplants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas\nover the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than \nthe\nyear before exacerbated the problem.\n\n??In another twist to California\'s deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials\nsaid they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas &\nElectric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E\'s\nmovement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the \nPublic\nUtilities Commission.\n\n??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the\nfederal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border\nand U.S. Sen.

Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a\ncostly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then \nget a\nrebate in the mail.\n\n??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of\napproximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced \nby\nthe amount of the vehicle license fee rebates.\n\n??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis\nan "urgency" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor\nhad previously fought for and defended.\n\n??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the\namount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and\nformer Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It\nhad been about 2% of a vehicle\'s market value.\n\n??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will\n"expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs."\n\n??The governor\'s muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the\nrebates last year, when he said Californians "don\'t appreciate the fact that\nthey\'re getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands."\n\n??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the\ncar tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which\nDavis felt would have a greater impact.\n\n??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002,\nwhen Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have\nfallen permanently, with no more rebates.\n\n??"The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial\nelection cycle," said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported\nreductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates.\n\n??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of\ntheir license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year.\n\n??"Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction\nof 67.5%," said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on\nJuly 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut.\n\n??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current "awkward system \n.\n. . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and \nthen\nawait a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to\nexplain."\n\n??But as the California economy tightened, the state\'s budget surplus shrank\nand taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy \nelectricity, \nthe costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment\nto Davis.\n\n??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were\nestimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year.\n\n??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to\neliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register\ntheir vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed.\n\n??"It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,"\nMcClintock said Thursday. "He didn\'t want it on his desk."\n\n??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as\nthe lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) \nwas\nsubstituted.\n\n??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis\'\nperformance on the issue in an "earlier time and a more just society" would \nhave\nresulted in his "public flogging by representatives of taxpayers."\n\n??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to\nDavis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday.\n\n??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order\nto take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because \nmotorists\nmust be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due.\n\n??"We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail\nthem by May 1 for the July 1 expiration," he said. "It will be a little tight,\nbut we will still make it."\n\n??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454\nmillion have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra \nadministrative\ncost of $ 9.4 million.\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????11 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n??????????????????????Copyright 2001 / Los Angeles Times\n\n??????????????????????????????Los Angeles Times\n\n?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition\n\nSECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk\n\nLENGTH: 453 words\n\nHEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST;\n\nLOCKYER ASKS JUDGE TO ORDER FIRMS TO RELEASE RECORDS\n\nBYLINE: ROBERT J.

"I\'m\ngoing to pit bull them," he said. "This is one we win."\n\n??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of\nCalifornia\'s flawed electricity deregulation plan.\n\n??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking \ncourt\naction of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be\nshared with other public agencies or its competitors.\n\n??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the\nattorney general\'s obligation to keep proprietary information confidential.\n\n??"We\'re glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can," said\nReliant spokesman Richard Wheatley.

Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of \nthe\nproblem but also about the need for swift federal intervention.\n\n??"This meeting did not have the word \'Democrat\' or \'Republican\' used once,"\nRep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at \nthe\nmeeting near Los Angeles International airport.\n\n??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must\nslash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again \nafford\nto buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity \non\ntheir behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co.\nand Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power\nsuppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy protection.\n\n??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly\nopposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California\nRepublicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the\nadministration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed\naside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological\nbelief in a free market.\n\n??"This is not a free-enterprise situation," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) \nsaid\nafter the meeting. "In fact, it\'s just the opposite."\n\n??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to\nCalifornia and those charged in other Western states, he said California \nclearly\nhas been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the\nFERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \n"market\npower" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.\n\n??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in\nSacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in\nCalifornia to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline\ninto the state.\n\n??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman\n(D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats \nand\nRepublicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the \nability\nof President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been \nmuch\nspeculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political \nmotive\nto help the state.\n\n??"We Democrats," said Sherman, "hope very much that our skepticism is proven\nwrong."\n\n??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the\ngovernor\'s newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he \nused\nthe meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians\nthis summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five\nRepublicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.\n\n??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with \nBush\nto discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors\nWednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in\nwhich, she said, he "ignored" her appeal for federal assistance.\n\n??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying \nthey\nappear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up\nprices.\n\n??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an\nAssembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had \nmanipulated\nthe market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that\nthey had, in effect, withheld access to it.\n\n??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver\ngas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and \ncausing\na surge in prices.\n\n??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared\nin California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased\nproduction last year in response to the energy crisis.\n\n??"We\'re not withholding capacity--no one is," said El Paso Merchant Energy\nPresident Ralph Eads. "With these prices, you want to sell every molecule."\n\n??In other developments Thursday:\n\n??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing\nutility arm to financial health is in "deep trouble and could be rejected by\nlegislators," the Standard & Poor\'s credit rating agency said in a note to\nclients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal "would \nbe\na humiliating setback for the governor," S&P said.\n\n??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison\'s\ntransmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion \nin\nbonds--both designed to pay off the utility\'s huge electricity debt. Edison\nagreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state \nat\nprices tied to the cost of producing power.\n\n??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have\nbeen sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to\ntinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a\nbankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a\ndire outcome.\n\n??But a senior Edison executive said it is "way too early" to give up on\npassage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\n\n??"There is an education process to do here," the executive said of the highly\ndetailed 38-page document. "The legislators should be asking questions. That \nis\nappropriate."\n\n??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative\nenergy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from\nPG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits\nsome providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the\ncash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy\naccount for more than 25% of California\'s electricity supply.\n\n??"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot\ndays of summer," Wood said.\n\n??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to\naddress the $ 700 million the producers are owed. "All we have gotten is\nrhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities," he said.\n\n??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious \nmegawatts\nappears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state\nofficials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.\n\n??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242\nmillion of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to\nthe state\'s investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation \nprograms.\n\n??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC\'s Division of Strategic Planning, said\nThursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection\nApril 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.\n\n??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E\'s\ndecision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could \nfollow a\nsimilar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency\'s efforts.\n\n??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the\nBankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and\nseparated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the\ncourt denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses\nanyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view\nof some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late \nspring\nand early summer.\n\n??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his\nagency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their\noutput during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the\nnecessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full \nfor\nearlier electricity deliveries.\n\n??"It\'s not a huge amount," he said of the anticipated production shortfall,\n"but every little bit helps."\n\n\n??*\n\n??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is\nsome willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the\nBush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures.\n\n??Many are looking to see if President Bush\'s choices for the two vacancies on\nFERC will provide a margin for change.\n\n??But the commission\'s basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are \nbest\nis not likely to change soon, members say.\n\n??"I\'ve been championing a revamping of FERC\'s antiquated standards for\ndetermining market-based rates," Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. \nBut\nwith no success. " My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this\nmarket-based pricing."\n\n??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns\ndown requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have \nbeen\ngiven that authority, he said.\n\n??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, \nit\nmust show FERC, for example, that it doesn\'t have the power to manipulate the\nmarket and drive prices up.\n\n??"Any seller that can\'t pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and\nlawyers," Massey said.\n\n??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to\nthe commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should \ntrigger\ncost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place \nfor\none year, under the staff proposal.\n\n??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has\nto make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now \non.\n\n??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, \nis\nthat during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to\nmanipulate the market and drive prices up.\n\n??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says\nLes Starck, Southern California Edison Co.\'s manager of federal regulatory\naffairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts \nassociated\nwith that level of crisis, but they wouldn\'t do anything to stop generators \nfrom\njacking up prices the rest of the time, he said.\n\n??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take\neffect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation.\n\n??"We\'re close because summer is approaching," Commissioner Linda Breathitt\nsaid Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls,\nsaid in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California\nshe was open to considering some short-term measures.\n\n??"It\'s important to me that we address the summer," Breathitt said, but said\nshe wasn\'t able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday.\n\n??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the\npower sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings\nare handled.\n\n??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be\n"better than having no controls at all. There\'s no question that we\'re going \nto\nbe in a Stage 3 emergency."\n\n??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to\nstep in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency\nperiod.\n\n??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene "is putting the whole grid at risk," said\nRoger Hamilton, a member of Oregon\'s Public Utility Commission. "We have a \nreal\nstability problem when you cut it that close."\n\n??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners,\nparticularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will\nreplace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate.\n\n??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman,\nHeber could block consideration of such a move. It\'s unclear what stance Wood\nwould take as chairman.\n\n??"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he\'s from Texas,"\nFeinstein said. "What\'s reassuring is that it appears from my personal\ndiscussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."\n\n??But once again, timing could be a problem.\n\n??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the\nPennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate.\n\n??"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now,\nand to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense," Feinstein\nsaid.

Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that \nthe\naverage daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a \nday\nin the last week of March, to $73 million a day.\n\n??Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\'s have already issued their \nown\ncredit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded \nthe\nstate\'s very good double-A credit rating.\n\n??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to \nprice\nmunicipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer\nbondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.\n\n??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.\n\n??Moody\'s changed California\'s Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from\nstable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for\nbankruptcy. Standard & Poor\'s has had the state\'s AA rating outlook at \nnegative\nsince January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities.\n\n??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was \nthe\ndisagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be\nspent.\n\n??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money\ngenerated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state\nDepartment of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the\nutilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid\nfirst, there won\'t be any money left for it.\n\n??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens\nto hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of\nWater Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.\n\n??"With that being appealed you don\'t have a clean authorization," Cohen said.\n"It signals to me that it could delay the financing process."\n\n??A second concern is that the state isn\'t collecting as much in taxes as\nexpected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below\nforecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those \nmonths\nfell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected.\n\n??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state\'s power costs\nnow exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California \nanalyst\nfor Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern.\n\n??"It doesn\'t take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these\nprojected fund balances disappear and so we\'re very worried about what the\ncurrent economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of\nthe problems with the high tech area," Hitchcock told analysts and investors\nlast week in a conference call.\n\n??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn\'t be\nreached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern.\n\n??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the\nmove reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon.\n\n??"It\'s important to note that the rating hasn\'t been lowered yet and does\nremain very strong," he said.\n\n??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune\n\n??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.).\n\n??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at\nhttp://www.sjmercury.com/\n \nJOURNAL-CODE: SJ\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????18 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service\n???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service\n\n????????????????????????????San Jose Mercury News\n\n????????????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday\n\nSECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS\n\nKR-ACC-NO: ?K520\n\nLENGTH: 1069 words\n\nHEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay\n\nBYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley\n\nBODY:\n\n??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate\nincrease that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit \nbills\nbeginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.\n\n??Now, much of that is up in the air.\n\n??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which \nconsumers\nand businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a \nrate\nstructure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals.\n\n??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis\' decision to\nweigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric\'s move into\nbankruptcy court.\n\n??"Little details are moving billions of dollars around," said Nettie Hoge of\nconsumer advocate group TURN.\n\n??All the proposals assume a "tiered" structure that forces the heaviest users\nof energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers\ncould see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or\nmore.\n\n??Among them:\n\n??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a\n3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility \nrevenue\n$4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis\' hike _ left vague in Davis\' April 5 television\naddress _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for \ncustomers\nof Southern California Edison.\n\n??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates\nonly for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis \nwould\ninclude the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.\n\n??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the\nnew rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more \nthan\nany of the average increase figures being tossed about.\n\n??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the\ntime of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take\neffect immediately.\n\n??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge\nworking for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate \nstructure\nto the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission\nwould vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally\nlasts nearly a year.\n\n??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential\ncustomers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from\nhigher rates. That\'s mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy\npower. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which \nis\nthe average basic level of use for each region of the state.\n\n??Each major proposal also sets new "tiers" with progressively higher rates \nfor\n"medium" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and "heavy" use over 200 \npercent\nof that level.\n\n??But that\'s where the similarities end.\n\n??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an\nassumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because \nthey\ndon\'t exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,\ncommissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.\n\n??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to\neveryone else?\n\n??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E\nusers would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills\nincrease 36 percent.\n\n??Davis\' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent\nwhile heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill \nincrease\nfor PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20\npercent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch\'s, according to a statement \non\nthe governor\'s web site.\n\n??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30\npercent under Lynch\'s proposal and 26 percent under Davis\'.\n\n??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from\nconsumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential \nincrease\nof just 7.5 percent.\n\n??TURN\'s plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up\nfor the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.\n\n??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential\nusers to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher\nrates. Under the utility\'s plan, residential customers would see an average \nrate\nhike of nearly 30 percent.\n\n??"The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law," said\nMatthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.\n\n??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for\nelectricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.\n\n??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.\nInstead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that\neveryone would pay, regardless of how much they use.\n\n??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of\ntime _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a\nsmaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.\n\n??"It\'ll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal," Paul Clanon, the\ncommission\'s director of energy issues.\n\n??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:\nCalifornia\'s current, frozen rates don\'t generate enough money to cover the\nwholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per\nkilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be \nfar\nfrom enough.\n\n??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis\nfollowed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for\nbankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher\nrates.\n\n??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis\'\nproposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed\nthree of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined \nto\nshow him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan,\nwhich has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n\n??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune\n\n??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.).\n\n??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at\nhttp://www.sjmercury.com/\n \nJOURNAL-CODE: SJ\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????19 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co.\n\n?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle\n\n????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITION\n\nSECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Financial analysts said a worsening of the state\'s\nenergy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates.\n\n???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least\nnot in its present form.\n\n???"We are going to go through this thing extensively," said state Senate\nPresident Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "There are a lot of concerns\nabout the valuation."\n\n???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long\nas Edison is open to amending some of the terms.\n\n???"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going \nto\nhave its say," Burton said.\n\n???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain\namount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common\nground with lawmakers.\n\n???"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"\nsaid Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. "There will be a big effort to \ntry\nand work something out."\n\n???Edison\'s Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his \ncompany\nas reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.\n\n???This contrasts sharply with the state\'s relations with PG&E, which turned\nacrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. \nEach\nside blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.\n\n???"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for\nthe state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would\nallow us to get on with operating our power system," Bryson said.\n\n???Bankruptcy, he said, "is absolutely a last resort. It\'s a long and costly\nprocess."\n\n???It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating\nagency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor\'s and Moody\'s Investor Service in\nwarning that California\'s credit rating could be lowered because of the \nstate\'s\nenergy mess.\n\n???"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds," said Carol Coale, an\nenergy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. "This could lead\nto a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."\n\n???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison\'s agreement with the governor as \na\nprudent alternative to bankruptcy.\n\n???"This is a very good deal for the state," he said. "It is not a bailout.\nEdison gives up a lot to make all this possible."\n\n???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8\nbillion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and \ndrop\na federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt.\n\n???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison\'s transmission\nsystem -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of\nlittle use unless PG&E\'s grid also can be acquired.\n\n???"It\'s a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison," said Doug Heller,\na spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa \nMonica.\n"Edison gets off scot-free."\n\n???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount\npaid for Edison\'s power lines and to increase the role of the California \nPublic\nUtilities Commission in regulating the utility.\n\n???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the \nstate\nif PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid.\n\n???"The deal on the table is still salvageable," said Michael Shames, \nexecutive\ndirector of the Utility Consumers\' Action Network in San Diego. "But Edison\nneeds to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, \nnot\nset in stone."\n\n???For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take\non the issue.\n\n???"We\'re just at the initial stage," he said. "We always have accepted the\nnotion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the \nlaws\nof the Public Utilities Commission."E-mail David Lazarus at\ndlazarus@sfchronicle.com.\n\nGRAPHIC: PHOTO, Gov.

The previous\nadministration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the\npresident said, \'I\'m focused on getting the job done,"\' Rove said Wednesday in\nan Associated Press interview.\n\n??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton,\nbut the style has its critics.\n\n??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have\nsaved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more\nlawmakers.\n\n??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in\nCincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached.\n\n??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House \nabout\nBush attending the U.S. crew\'s homecoming to reap the public relations reward\nfor freeing the crew.\n\n??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as\nsaying, "I want it to be about them and I don\'t want to go through the\ndiscombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to \nshow\nup."\n\n??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots,\na budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, "We intended to \nhave\na smaller profile than the previous administration."\n\n??Bush\'s "attitude is that he\'s not going to be measured by whether or not he\ngets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress," Rove said\nduring the 45-minute interview.\n\n??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his \nhands\nfolded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a\nStarbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were\npropped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White\nHouse.\n\n??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush\'s \npolitical\nstrategist of eight years to "go on vacation whenever I\'m on the phone."\n\n??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the\nWhite House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and\nposition the president for a re-election bid in 2004.\n\n??Bush narrowly won the White House without California\'s 54 electoral votes,\nand Rove said the president could win re-election without the state "but it\'s\nalways nicer to carry the Golden State."\n\n??He said the state\'s electricity shortage will not hurt Bush\'s chances in\n2004, adding that the administration has done "virtually everything" Gov. Gray\nDavis has requested.\n\n??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough\npower plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush\'s\nTexas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck.\n\n??"This has got a very human dimension to it," Rove said. "It\'s one thing to\ntalk about power supplies. It\'s another thing when you talk about how it \naffects\ntheir jobs, how it\'s affecting their livelihoods, how it\'s affecting the \nsafety\nof their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue \nand\nit ought to be a wake up call for the entire country."\n\n??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on\nrecommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and\nnatural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on \nproducing\nmore domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants.\n\n??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures \naimed\nat helping California ease its shortages.\n\n??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from\npolitically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their\ndistricts\' needs and, often, gain local media attention.\n\n??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign\ncommittees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which\ncontrol of Congress is at stake.\n\n??Rove also said:\n\n??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime \nsoon,\nallowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. "You can\nonly put so much into that pipe, and we\'ve stuffed it," he said of Bush\'s\ncrowded legislative agenda. The "fast track" authority is key to Bush\'s plans\nfor a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the\nfocus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City.\n\n??-Americans will support Bush\'s environmental policies despite criticism of\nhis decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton\nadministration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for\npolitical troubles. "I\'m not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it\'s\ninteresting" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act.\n\n??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be\nable to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For\nresidential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16\npercent.\n\n??"This is not a final decision," said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP \nand\nIdaho Power. "In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff."\n\n??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between\nIdaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the\nstaff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy\nelectricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it.\n\n??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP,\nrepeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to\nIdaho Power for a profit.\n\n??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could \nfinancially\ncripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open\nmarket and cannot recover the money unless the coming year\'s rate is \nincreased.\n\n??"The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems," Beaman\nsaid, "and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well."\n\n??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees\n- a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company \nhad\nachieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before.\n\n??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request.\n\n??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a\ncommission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale\nelectricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at \nunrealistic\nlevels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates \nconstantly.\n\n??"We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and\nspirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers," Beaman \nsaid.\n\n??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a \ncase\nbefore them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme\nCourt.\n\n??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended:\n\n??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power\'s rate request, without interest,\nuntil answers are available about the company\'s electricity deals.\n\n??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the\ncommissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part\nof the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases\nthat the staff believes will be much more expensive next year.\n\n??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was\nan error by Idaho Power\'s Risk Management Committee that the company planned \non\npassing on to ratepayers.\n\n??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation\nby Idaho Power customers.\n\n??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is\nsubstantially over 20 percent.\n\n??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings.\n\n??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh \nused,\n6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per \nkwh\nfor use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh.\n\n??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the\npossibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995.\n\n??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during\nthe past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew \nwhat\nindependent power facilities were being considered.\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????30 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire\n\nThe materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These\nmaterials may not be republished without the express written consent of The\nAssociated Press.\n\n??????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, BC cycle\n\nSECTION: State and Regional\n\nLENGTH: 820 words\n\nHEADLINE: Legislators probe possible power, natural gas collusion\n\nBYLINE: By DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer\n\nDATELINE: SACRAMENTO\n\nBODY:\n\n??Southern California Edison was charged about $750 million more this year for\nnatural gas because of unchecked free-market forces, an industry consultant\ntestified.\n\n??Paul Carpenter told the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee on\nWednesday the price spikes came after the El Paso Natural Gas Co. contracted\nfirst with Dynegy and later with its own marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant\nEnergy, to control the pipeline capacity.\n\n??Officials with El Paso and other natural gas suppliers are expected to\ntestify Thursday that they did not illegally manipulate the market.\n\n??The California Public Utilities Commission estimated a year ago that\novercharges by the companies that control natural gas flow drove up prices by \n$\n100 million a year to California gas and electricity customers.\n\n??But PUC attorney Harvey Morris said that was before last summer\'s price\nspikes, which he blamed on natural gas suppliers using a "monopoly" to "game \nthe\nsystem."\n\n??"It\'s way worse than we could possibly have imagined," Morris said after\ntestifying before the subcommittee. "It\'s obviously way higher than $100\nmillion."\n\n??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices\nuntil November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of\nnatural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said.\n\n??"I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world," said\nCarpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge,\nMass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by \nEdison\nto study the natural gas market.\n\n??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal\nmarket manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up\nCalifornia\'s energy costs.\n\n??"This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power," Frank\nWolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator\'s Market\nSurveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price\nManipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state\'s power\ngrid.\n\n??However, "there is no law against me saying, \'I\'m not going to sell to \nyou,"\'\nWolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion,\nWolak said, and such evidence is hard to find.\n\n??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and\ndemand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices.\n\n??"Everybody\'s busy doing investigations. They\'re not interested in solving \nthe\nproblem," said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan \nSmutny-Jones.\n\n??Investigations "are wasting everybody\'s time," Smutny-Jones said, adding \nthat\nprevious probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state\'s\npower problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to \nsign\nlong-term energy contracts when they had the chance.\n\n??"People have been playing by the rules," Smutny-Jones said.\n\n??But the Senate committee\'s first witnesses are ISO officials who authored\nstudies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last\nyear.\n\n??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor\nElaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing\nelectricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, \nfederal,\nacademic and private investigators studying the power market.\n\n??He invited five major generators to attend the committee\'s second hearing\nnext week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and \nMirant -\nsay they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said.\n\n??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies\nfeel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality \nconcerns,\nDunn said he will subpoena them.\n\n??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the\nstate\'s natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation\ninstead of natural market forces.\n\n??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer\'s announcement last week that any\ninformant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the\nstate\'s recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of\nmillions of dollars.\n\n??"If the state\'s offering a $50 million reward, they haven\'t found anything,"\nSmutny-Jones said.

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen \n489\npercent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent \njump\nin Chicago.\n\n??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co.\nsubsidiary, for an explanation.\n\n??"The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to \nconstraints\non the pipeline and demand?" Steinberg asked.\n\n??"Yes," Eads replied. Eads said the state\'s energy crisis, which led power\nplants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas\nover the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than \nthe\nyear before exacerbated the problem.\n\n??In another twist to California\'s deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials\nsaid they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas &\nElectric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E\'s\nmovement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the \nPublic\nUtilities Commission.\n\n??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the\nfederal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border\nand U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose\nprice caps on California\'s wholesale electricity market.\n\n??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for\nre-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing \nnothing\nto come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration.\n\n??"I\'m learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world\nstarted after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president," said\nAssemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino.\n\n??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune\n\n??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.).\n\n??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/\n \nJOURNAL-CODE: CC\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????10 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n??????????????????????Copyright 2001 / Los Angeles Times\n\n??????????????????????????????Los Angeles Times\n\n?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition\n\nSECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk\n\nLENGTH: 715 words\n\nHEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST;\n\nA U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES;\n\nLEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO\nVEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL.\n\nBYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER\n\n\n\nDATELINE: SACRAMENTO\n\nBODY:\n\n\n??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a\ncostly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then \nget a\nrebate in the mail.\n\n??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of\napproximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced \nby\nthe amount of the vehicle license fee rebates.\n\n??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis\nan "urgency" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor\nhad previously fought for and defended.\n\n??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the\namount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and\nformer Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It\nhad been about 2% of a vehicle\'s market value.\n\n??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will\n"expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs."\n\n??The governor\'s muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the\nrebates last year, when he said Californians "don\'t appreciate the fact that\nthey\'re getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands."\n\n??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the\ncar tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which\nDavis felt would have a greater impact.\n\n??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002,\nwhen Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have\nfallen permanently, with no more rebates.\n\n??"The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial\nelection cycle," said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported\nreductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates.\n\n??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of\ntheir license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year.\n\n??"Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction\nof 67.5%," said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on\nJuly 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut.\n\n??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current "awkward system \n.\n. . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and \nthen\nawait a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to\nexplain."\n\n??But as the California economy tightened, the state\'s budget surplus shrank\nand taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy \nelectricity, \nthe costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment\nto Davis.\n\n??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were\nestimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year.\n\n??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to\neliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register\ntheir vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed.\n\n??"It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,"\nMcClintock said Thursday. "He didn\'t want it on his desk."\n\n??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as\nthe lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) \nwas\nsubstituted.\n\n??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis\'\nperformance on the issue in an "earlier time and a more just society" would \nhave\nresulted in his "public flogging by representatives of taxpayers."\n\n??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to\nDavis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday.\n\n??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order\nto take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because \nmotorists\nmust be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due.\n\n??"We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail\nthem by May 1 for the July 1 expiration," he said. "It will be a little tight,\nbut we will still make it."\n\n??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454\nmillion have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra \nadministrative\ncost of $ 9.4 million.\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????11 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n??????????????????????Copyright 2001 / Los Angeles Times\n\n??????????????????????????????Los Angeles Times\n\n?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home Edition\n\nSECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro Desk\n\nLENGTH: 453 words\n\nHEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST;\n\nLOCKYER ASKS JUDGE TO ORDER FIRMS TO RELEASE RECORDS\n\nBYLINE: ROBERT J.

"I\'m\ngoing to pit bull them," he said. "This is one we win."\n\n??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of\nCalifornia\'s flawed electricity deregulation plan.\n\n??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking \ncourt\naction of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be\nshared with other public agencies or its competitors.\n\n??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the\nattorney general\'s obligation to keep proprietary information confidential.\n\n??"We\'re glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can," said\nReliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. " But we have not received sufficient\nassurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential."\n\n??Lockyer called Reliant\'s court filing "frivolous" and "propagandistic" and\ninsisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under\nstate law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his\ninvestigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from\nbeing made public.\n\n??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of\nconfidentiality, Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday.\n\n??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information \nhe\'s\nseeking. But based on the investigation so far, he said, "it\'s beginning to \nget\ninteresting."\n\n??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of\ninformation about the power merchants\' activities.

Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of \nthe\nproblem but also about the need for swift federal intervention.\n\n??"This meeting did not have the word \'Democrat\' or \'Republican\' used once,"\nRep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at \nthe\nmeeting near Los Angeles International airport.\n\n??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must\nslash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again \nafford\nto buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity \non\ntheir behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co.\nand Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power\nsuppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11\nbankruptcy protection.\n\n??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly\nopposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California\nRepublicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the\nadministration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed\naside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological\nbelief in a free market.\n\n??"This is not a free-enterprise situation," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) \nsaid\nafter the meeting. "In fact, it\'s just the opposite."\n\n??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to\nCalifornia and those charged in other Western states, he said California \nclearly\nhas been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the\nFERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting \n"market\npower" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.\n\n??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in\nSacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in\nCalifornia to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline\ninto the state.\n\n??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman\n(D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats \nand\nRepublicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the \nability\nof President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been \nmuch\nspeculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political \nmotive\nto help the state.\n\n??"We Democrats," said Sherman, "hope very much that our skepticism is proven\nwrong."\n\n??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the\ngovernor\'s newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he \nused\nthe meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians\nthis summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five\nRepublicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.\n\n??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with \nBush\nto discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors\nWednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in\nwhich, she said, he "ignored" her appeal for federal assistance.\n\n??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying \nthey\nappear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up\nprices.\n\n??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an\nAssembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had \nmanipulated\nthe market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that\nthey had, in effect, withheld access to it.\n\n??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver\ngas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and \ncausing\na surge in prices.\n\n??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared\nin California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased\nproduction last year in response to the energy crisis.\n\n??"We\'re not withholding capacity--no one is," said El Paso Merchant Energy\nPresident Ralph Eads. "With these prices, you want to sell every molecule."\n\n??In other developments Thursday:\n\n??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing\nutility arm to financial health is in "deep trouble and could be rejected by\nlegislators," the Standard & Poor\'s credit rating agency said in a note to\nclients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal "would \nbe\na humiliating setback for the governor," S&P said.\n\n??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison\'s\ntransmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion \nin\nbonds--both designed to pay off the utility\'s huge electricity debt. Edison\nagreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state \nat\nprices tied to the cost of producing power.\n\n??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have\nbeen sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to\ntinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a\nbankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a\ndire outcome.\n\n??But a senior Edison executive said it is "way too early" to give up on\npassage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.\n\n??"There is an education process to do here," the executive said of the highly\ndetailed 38-page document. "The legislators should be asking questions. That \nis\nappropriate."\n\n??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative\nenergy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from\nPG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits\nsome providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the\ncash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy\naccount for more than 25% of California\'s electricity supply.\n\n??"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot\ndays of summer," Wood said.\n\n??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to\naddress the $ 700 million the producers are owed. "All we have gotten is\nrhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities," he said.\n\n??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious \nmegawatts\nappears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state\nofficials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.\n\n??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242\nmillion of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to\nthe state\'s investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation \nprograms.\n\n??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC\'s Division of Strategic Planning, said\nThursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection\nApril 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.\n\n??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E\'s\ndecision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could \nfollow a\nsimilar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency\'s efforts.\n\n??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the\nBankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and\nseparated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the\ncourt denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses\nanyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view\nof some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late \nspring\nand early summer.\n\n??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his\nagency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their\noutput during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the\nnecessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full \nfor\nearlier electricity deliveries.\n\n??"It\'s not a huge amount," he said of the anticipated production shortfall,\n"but every little bit helps."\n\n\n??*\n\n??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is\nsome willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the\nBush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures.\n\n??Many are looking to see if President Bush\'s choices for the two vacancies on\nFERC will provide a margin for change.\n\n??But the commission\'s basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are \nbest\nis not likely to change soon, members say.\n\n??"I\'ve been championing a revamping of FERC\'s antiquated standards for\ndetermining market-based rates," Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. \nBut\nwith no success. " My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this\nmarket-based pricing."\n\n??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns\ndown requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have \nbeen\ngiven that authority, he said.\n\n??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, \nit\nmust show FERC, for example, that it doesn\'t have the power to manipulate the\nmarket and drive prices up.\n\n??"Any seller that can\'t pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and\nlawyers," Massey said.\n\n??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to\nthe commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should \ntrigger\ncost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place \nfor\none year, under the staff proposal.\n\n??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has\nto make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now \non.\n\n??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, \nis\nthat during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to\nmanipulate the market and drive prices up.\n\n??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says\nLes Starck, Southern California Edison Co.\'s manager of federal regulatory\naffairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts \nassociated\nwith that level of crisis, but they wouldn\'t do anything to stop generators \nfrom\njacking up prices the rest of the time, he said.\n\n??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take\neffect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation.\n\n??"We\'re close because summer is approaching," Commissioner Linda Breathitt\nsaid Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls,\nsaid in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California\nshe was open to considering some short-term measures.\n\n??"It\'s important to me that we address the summer," Breathitt said, but said\nshe wasn\'t able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday.\n\n??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the\npower sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings\nare handled.\n\n??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be\n"better than having no controls at all. There\'s no question that we\'re going \nto\nbe in a Stage 3 emergency."\n\n??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to\nstep in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency\nperiod.\n\n??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene "is putting the whole grid at risk," said\nRoger Hamilton, a member of Oregon\'s Public Utility Commission. "We have a \nreal\nstability problem when you cut it that close."\n\n??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners,\nparticularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will\nreplace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate.\n\n??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman,\nHeber could block consideration of such a move. It\'s unclear what stance Wood\nwould take as chairman.\n\n??"The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he\'s from Texas,"\nFeinstein said. "What\'s reassuring is that it appears from my personal\ndiscussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic."\n\n??But once again, timing could be a problem.\n\n??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the\nPennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate.\n\n??"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now,\nand to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense," Feinstein\nsaid.

Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that \nthe\naverage daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a \nday\nin the last week of March, to $73 million a day.\n\n??Moody\'s Investors Service and Standard & Poor\'s have already issued their \nown\ncredit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded \nthe\nstate\'s very good double-A credit rating.\n\n??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to \nprice\nmunicipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer\nbondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.\n\n??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.\n\n??Moody\'s changed California\'s Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from\nstable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for\nbankruptcy. Standard & Poor\'s has had the state\'s AA rating outlook at \nnegative\nsince January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities.\n\n??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was \nthe\ndisagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be\nspent.\n\n??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money\ngenerated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state\nDepartment of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the\nutilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid\nfirst, there won\'t be any money left for it.\n\n??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens\nto hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of\nWater Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.\n\n??"With that being appealed you don\'t have a clean authorization," Cohen said.\n"It signals to me that it could delay the financing process."\n\n??A second concern is that the state isn\'t collecting as much in taxes as\nexpected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below\nforecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those \nmonths\nfell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected.\n\n??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state\'s power costs\nnow exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California \nanalyst\nfor Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern.\n\n??"It doesn\'t take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these\nprojected fund balances disappear and so we\'re very worried about what the\ncurrent economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of\nthe problems with the high tech area," Hitchcock told analysts and investors\nlast week in a conference call.\n\n??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn\'t be\nreached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern.\n\n??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the\nmove reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon.\n\n??"It\'s important to note that the rating hasn\'t been lowered yet and does\nremain very strong," he said.\n\n??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune\n\n??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.).\n\n??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at\nhttp://www.sjmercury.com/\n \nJOURNAL-CODE: SJ\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????18 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service\n???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service\n\n????????????????????????????San Jose Mercury News\n\n????????????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday\n\nSECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS\n\nKR-ACC-NO: ?K520\n\nLENGTH: 1069 words\n\nHEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay\n\nBYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley\n\nBODY:\n\n??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate\nincrease that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit \nbills\nbeginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.\n\n??Now, much of that is up in the air.\n\n??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which \nconsumers\nand businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a \nrate\nstructure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals.\n\n??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis\' decision to\nweigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric\'s move into\nbankruptcy court.\n\n??"Little details are moving billions of dollars around," said Nettie Hoge of\nconsumer advocate group TURN.\n\n??All the proposals assume a "tiered" structure that forces the heaviest users\nof energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers\ncould see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or\nmore.\n\n??Among them:\n\n??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a\n3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility \nrevenue\n$4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis\' hike _ left vague in Davis\' April 5 television\naddress _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for \ncustomers\nof Southern California Edison.\n\n??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates\nonly for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis \nwould\ninclude the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.\n\n??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the\nnew rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more \nthan\nany of the average increase figures being tossed about.\n\n??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the\ntime of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take\neffect immediately.\n\n??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge\nworking for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate \nstructure\nto the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission\nwould vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally\nlasts nearly a year.\n\n??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential\ncustomers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from\nhigher rates. That\'s mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy\npower. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which \nis\nthe average basic level of use for each region of the state.\n\n??Each major proposal also sets new "tiers" with progressively higher rates \nfor\n"medium" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and "heavy" use over 200 \npercent\nof that level.\n\n??But that\'s where the similarities end.\n\n??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an\nassumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because \nthey\ndon\'t exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,\ncommissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.\n\n??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to\neveryone else?\n\n??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E\nusers would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills\nincrease 36 percent.\n\n??Davis\' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent\nwhile heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill \nincrease\nfor PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20\npercent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch\'s, according to a statement \non\nthe governor\'s web site.\n\n??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30\npercent under Lynch\'s proposal and 26 percent under Davis\'.\n\n??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from\nconsumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential \nincrease\nof just 7.5 percent.\n\n??TURN\'s plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up\nfor the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.\n\n??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential\nusers to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher\nrates. Under the utility\'s plan, residential customers would see an average \nrate\nhike of nearly 30 percent.\n\n??"The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law," said\nMatthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.\n\n??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for\nelectricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.\n\n??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.\nInstead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that\neveryone would pay, regardless of how much they use.\n\n??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of\ntime _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a\nsmaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.\n\n??"It\'ll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal," Paul Clanon, the\ncommission\'s director of energy issues.\n\n??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:\nCalifornia\'s current, frozen rates don\'t generate enough money to cover the\nwholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per\nkilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be \nfar\nfrom enough.\n\n??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis\nfollowed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for\nbankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher\nrates.\n\n??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis\'\nproposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed\nthree of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined \nto\nshow him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan,\nwhich has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.\n\n??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune\n\n??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.).\n\n??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, at\nhttp://www.sjmercury.com/\n \nJOURNAL-CODE: SJ\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????19 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co.\n\n?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle\n\n????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITION\n\nSECTION: NEWS; Pg.

Financial analysts said a worsening of the state\'s\nenergy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates.\n\n???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least\nnot in its present form.\n\n???"We are going to go through this thing extensively," said state Senate\nPresident Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "There are a lot of concerns\nabout the valuation."\n\n???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long\nas Edison is open to amending some of the terms.\n\n???"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going \nto\nhave its say," Burton said.\n\n???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain\namount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common\nground with lawmakers.\n\n???"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"\nsaid Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. "There will be a big effort to \ntry\nand work something out."\n\n???Edison\'s Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his \ncompany\nas reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.\n\n???This contrasts sharply with the state\'s relations with PG&E, which turned\nacrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. \nEach\nside blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.\n\n???"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for\nthe state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would\nallow us to get on with operating our power system," Bryson said.\n\n???Bankruptcy, he said, "is absolutely a last resort. It\'s a long and costly\nprocess."\n\n???It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating\nagency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor\'s and Moody\'s Investor Service in\nwarning that California\'s credit rating could be lowered because of the \nstate\'s\nenergy mess.\n\n???"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds," said Carol Coale, an\nenergy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. "This could lead\nto a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."\n\n???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison\'s agreement with the governor as \na\nprudent alternative to bankruptcy.\n\n???"This is a very good deal for the state," he said. "It is not a bailout.\nEdison gives up a lot to make all this possible."\n\n???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8\nbillion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and \ndrop\na federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt.\n\n???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison\'s transmission\nsystem -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of\nlittle use unless PG&E\'s grid also can be acquired.\n\n???"It\'s a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison," said Doug Heller,\na spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa \nMonica.\n"Edison gets off scot-free."\n\n???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount\npaid for Edison\'s power lines and to increase the role of the California \nPublic\nUtilities Commission in regulating the utility.\n\n???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the \nstate\nif PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid.\n\n???"The deal on the table is still salvageable," said Michael Shames, \nexecutive\ndirector of the Utility Consumers\' Action Network in San Diego. "But Edison\nneeds to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, \nnot\nset in stone."\n\n???For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take\non the issue.\n\n???"We\'re just at the initial stage," he said.

The previous\nadministration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the\npresident said, \'I\'m focused on getting the job done,"\' Rove said Wednesday in\nan Associated Press interview.\n\n??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton,\nbut the style has its critics.\n\n??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have\nsaved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more\nlawmakers.\n\n??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in\nCincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached.\n\n??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House \nabout\nBush attending the U.S. crew\'s homecoming to reap the public relations reward\nfor freeing the crew.\n\n??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as\nsaying, "I want it to be about them and I don\'t want to go through the\ndiscombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to \nshow\nup."\n\n??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots,\na budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, "We intended to \nhave\na smaller profile than the previous administration."\n\n??Bush\'s "attitude is that he\'s not going to be measured by whether or not he\ngets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress," Rove said\nduring the 45-minute interview.\n\n??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his \nhands\nfolded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a\nStarbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were\npropped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White\nHouse.\n\n??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush\'s \npolitical\nstrategist of eight years to "go on vacation whenever I\'m on the phone."\n\n??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the\nWhite House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and\nposition the president for a re-election bid in 2004.\n\n??Bush narrowly won the White House without California\'s 54 electoral votes,\nand Rove said the president could win re-election without the state "but it\'s\nalways nicer to carry the Golden State."\n\n??He said the state\'s electricity shortage will not hurt Bush\'s chances in\n2004, adding that the administration has done "virtually everything" Gov. Gray\nDavis has requested.\n\n??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough\npower plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush\'s\nTexas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck.\n\n??"This has got a very human dimension to it," Rove said. "It\'s one thing to\ntalk about power supplies. It\'s another thing when you talk about how it \naffects\ntheir jobs, how it\'s affecting their livelihoods, how it\'s affecting the \nsafety\nof their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue \nand\nit ought to be a wake up call for the entire country."\n\n??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on\nrecommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and\nnatural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on \nproducing\nmore domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants.\n\n??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures \naimed\nat helping California ease its shortages.\n\n??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from\npolitically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their\ndistricts\' needs and, often, gain local media attention.\n\n??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign\ncommittees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which\ncontrol of Congress is at stake.\n\n??Rove also said:\n\n??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime \nsoon,\nallowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. "You can\nonly put so much into that pipe, and we\'ve stuffed it," he said of Bush\'s\ncrowded legislative agenda. The "fast track" authority is key to Bush\'s plans\nfor a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the\nfocus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City.\n\n??-Americans will support Bush\'s environmental policies despite criticism of\nhis decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton\nadministration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for\npolitical troubles. "I\'m not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it\'s\ninteresting" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act.\n\n??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be\nable to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. "We are not all\none single labor market," Rove said.\n\nGRAPHIC: AP Photo WX109\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????29 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire\n\nThe materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These\nmaterials may not be republished without the express written consent of The\nAssociated Press.\n\n??????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, BC cycle\n\nSECTION: State and Regional\n\nLENGTH: 727 words\n\nHEADLINE: Utility commission staff says parent company profiting from energy\nsales\n\nDATELINE: BOISE, Idaho\n\nBODY:\n\n??IDACORP made $66 million in profits in the past year by buying electricity \non\nthe spot market and reselling it for a higher price to its subsidiary, Idaho\nPower Co., the staff for state utility regulators contends.\n\n??The Idaho Public Utilities Commission staff said such profits should not \ncome\nat the expense of Idaho Power ratepayers facing staggering electrical bills.\n\n??In a report to commissioners posted on the agency\'s Internet site Wednesday,\nthe staff recommended Idaho Power\'s proposed increases for residential and\ncommercial customers be cut by about half.\n\n??Idaho Power seeks rate increases over the coming year totaling $227.4\nmillion. The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For\nresidential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16\npercent.\n\n??"This is not a final decision," said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP \nand\nIdaho Power. "In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff."\n\n??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between\nIdaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the\nstaff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy\nelectricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it.\n\n??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP,\nrepeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to\nIdaho Power for a profit.\n\n??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could \nfinancially\ncripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open\nmarket and cannot recover the money unless the coming year\'s rate is \nincreased.\n\n??"The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems," Beaman\nsaid, "and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well."\n\n??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees\n- a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company \nhad\nachieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before.\n\n??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request.\n\n??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a\ncommission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale\nelectricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at \nunrealistic\nlevels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates \nconstantly.\n\n??"We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and\nspirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers," Beaman \nsaid.\n\n??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a \ncase\nbefore them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme\nCourt.\n\n??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended:\n\n??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power\'s rate request, without interest,\nuntil answers are available about the company\'s electricity deals.\n\n??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the\ncommissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part\nof the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases\nthat the staff believes will be much more expensive next year.\n\n??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was\nan error by Idaho Power\'s Risk Management Committee that the company planned \non\npassing on to ratepayers.\n\n??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation\nby Idaho Power customers.\n\n??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is\nsubstantially over 20 percent.\n\n??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings.\n\n??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh \nused,\n6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per \nkwh\nfor use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh.\n\n??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the\npossibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995.\n\n??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during\nthe past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew \nwhat\nindependent power facilities were being considered.\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n??????????????????????????????30 of 78 DOCUMENTS\n\n???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire\n\nThe materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These\nmaterials may not be republished without the express written consent of The\nAssociated Press.\n\n??????????????????????April 19, 2001, Thursday, BC cycle\n\nSECTION: State and Regional\n\nLENGTH: 820 words\n\nHEADLINE: Legislators probe possible power, natural gas collusion\n\nBYLINE: By DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer\n\nDATELINE: SACRAMENTO\n\nBODY:\n\n??Southern California Edison was charged about $750 million more this year for\nnatural gas because of unchecked free-market forces, an industry consultant\ntestified.\n\n??Paul Carpenter told the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee on\nWednesday the price spikes came after the El Paso Natural Gas Co. contracted\nfirst with Dynegy and later with its own marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant\nEnergy, to control the pipeline capacity.\n\n??Officials with El Paso and other natural gas suppliers are expected to\ntestify Thursday that they did not illegally manipulate the market.\n\n??The California Public Utilities Commission estimated a year ago that\novercharges by the companies that control natural gas flow drove up prices by \n$\n100 million a year to California gas and electricity customers.\n\n??But PUC attorney Harvey Morris said that was before last summer\'s price\nspikes, which he blamed on natural gas suppliers using a "monopoly" to "game \nthe\nsystem."\n\n??"It\'s way worse than we could possibly have imagined," Morris said after\ntestifying before the subcommittee. "It\'s obviously way higher than $100\nmillion."\n\n??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices\nuntil November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of\nnatural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said.\n\n??"I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world," said\nCarpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge,\nMass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by \nEdison\nto study the natural gas market.\n\n??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal\nmarket manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up\nCalifornia\'s energy costs.\n\n??"This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power," Frank\nWolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator\'s Market\nSurveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price\nManipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state\'s power\ngrid.\n\n??However, "there is no law against me saying, \'I\'m not going to sell to \nyou,"\'\nWolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion,\nWolak said, and such evidence is hard to find.\n\n??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and\ndemand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices.\n\n??"Everybody\'s busy doing investigations. They\'re not interested in solving \nthe\nproblem," said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan \nSmutny-Jones.\n\n??Investigations "are wasting everybody\'s time," Smutny-Jones said, adding \nthat\nprevious probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state\'s\npower problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to \nsign\nlong-term energy contracts when they had the chance.\n\n??"People have been playing by the rules," Smutny-Jones said.\n\n??But the Senate committee\'s first witnesses are ISO officials who authored\nstudies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last\nyear.\n\n??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor\nElaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing\nelectricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, \nfederal,\nacademic and private investigators studying the power market.\n\n??He invited five major generators to attend the committee\'s second hearing\nnext week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and \nMirant -\nsay they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said.\n\n??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies\nfeel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality \nconcerns,\nDunn said he will subpoena them.\n\n??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the\nstate\'s natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation\ninstead of natural market forces.\n\n??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer\'s announcement last week that any\ninformant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the\nstate\'s recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of\nmillions of dollars.\n\n??"If the state\'s offering a $50 million reward, they haven\'t found anything,"\nSmutny-Jones said. "I don\'t think you\'re going to find the fact that anybody \ndid\nanything criminal here."\n\n??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after\nWednesday\'s testimony: "I think it is very clear there was some price\nmanipulation going on."\n\n??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn\'t sure there was anything\nillegal.\n\n??"There clearly are market forces at work, that\'s evident," Campbell said.\n"Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven\'t seen \nconclusive\nevidence that leads me to make that jump."\n\nLOAD-DATE: April 20, 2001\n\n\n\n ',

SB 28x\n(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many\nIEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added\nto the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing\nwith both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating\nfacilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided\nnot to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision\nremained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold\ntheir opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate\non the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that\nalready have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon\nlanguage which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the\ncompletion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of\nthe air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The\nschedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such\nlater date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.\n\nWith these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be\nvoted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for\nconcurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following\nIEP-sponsored proposals:\n\n? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act\nrequirements\n? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=\nC\n? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power\nplant sites\n? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed\nproject.\n? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency\nreview.\n? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process\nestablished in AB 970.\n\nSince SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,\nIEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still\non the table include:\n\n? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for\npower plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance\n? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies\n? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.\n? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements\n\n-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=\n news.\nThe CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new\npower plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited\npermitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=\n.\nBoth documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This\nissue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to\ninclude a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power\nplant project.\n\nAB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a\ndeveloper enter into a contract to sell power to specified California\nentities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP\nmembers company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure\nregardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are\ndefinitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.\n\n-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=\nents\nattempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x\n(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=\nf\nthe bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the\nAuthority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=\n be\nfound on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17\n(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton\nin the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most\nlikely the best we could get.\n\n-- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee=\n to\nInvestigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.\nThis week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati=\nons\ninto market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:\nFrank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric\nHildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State\nAuditor.\n\n--  The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and\nfocused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the\ncommittee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the\nrise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and\ncollusion occurred.  The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o=\nf\nbills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the\ncommittee=01,s hearings over the last two months.  This package will be up =\nfor\nconsideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee.\n\n-- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the\nCalpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th=\ne\nSan Jose region.

SB 28x\n(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many\nIEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added\nto the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing\nwith both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating\nfacilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided\nnot to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision\nremained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold\ntheir opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate\non the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that\nalready have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon\nlanguage which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the\ncompletion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of\nthe air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The\nschedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such\nlater date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.\n\nWith these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be\nvoted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for\nconcurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following\nIEP-sponsored proposals:\n\n? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act\nrequirements\n? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=\nC\n? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power\nplant sites\n? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed\nproject.\n? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency\nreview.\n? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process\nestablished in AB 970.\n\nSince SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,\nIEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still\non the table include:\n\n? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for\npower plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance\n? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies\n? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.\n? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements\n\n-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=\n news.\nThe CEC staff analysis which said the State can\'t require builders of new\npower plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited\npermitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=\n.\nBoth documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This\nissue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to\ninclude a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power\nplant project.\n\nAB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a\ndeveloper enter into a contract to sell power to specified California\nentities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP\nmembers company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure\nregardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are\ndefinitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.\n\n-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=\nents\nattempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x\n(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=\nf\nthe bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the\nAuthority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=\n be\nfound on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17\n(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton\nin the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most\nlikely the best we could get.\n\n-- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee=\n to\nInvestigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.\nThis week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati=\nons\ninto market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:\nFrank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric\nHildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State\nAuditor.\n\n--  The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and\nfocused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the\ncommittee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the\nrise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and\ncollusion occurred.  The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o=\nf\nbills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the\ncommittee=01,s hearings over the last two months.  This package will be up =\nfor\nconsideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee.\n\n-- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the\nCalpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th=\ne\nSan Jose region.

She characterized the RTO \nfiling requirement as "bizarre".  It appears to me that it is typical FERC \nbehavior; FERC likes to use whatever leverage it has to force compliance.\n\n\nApril 27, 2001\n\nPlan on California Energy Has No Shortage of Critics\nBy JOSEPH KAHN\n\nWASHINGTON, April 26 * A novel plan by federal regulators to control \nCalifornia\'s runaway electricity prices is a messy, politically motivated \ncompromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix \nthe state\'s dysfunctional energy market, analysts said today.\n\nThe intervention, announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on \nWednesday night after much haggling, was dismissed by a wide range of critics \ntoday as a flawed effort that satisfies no one.\n\nIt fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation \nthat California officials and some energy experts had advocated. But it also \ncrossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders, \nincluding President Bush, by imposing price controls on some electricity \nsales to utilities.\n\nUnder the agency\'s order, which takes effect on May 1, California regulators \ncan begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity \nsupplies fall to within 7.5 percent of consumer demand. The state is expected \nto face such shortages routinely this summer, and the order has the potential \nto shave billions of dollars off California\'s electricity bill if implemented \nfully, some people at the federal agency say.\n\n"The president has a long-held belief that price caps don\'t work," the White \nHouse press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today. "The last thing you want to \ndo is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm \nthe availability of supply."\n\nMr. Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal \nagency, adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand \nits orders.\n\nBut Mr. Bush did appoint the commission\'s chairman, Curtis L. H,bert Jr., a \nRepublican. Like the president, Mr. H,bert has often insisted that price caps \ndo no good. But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the \nagency\'s largely hands- off approach to the California crisis. Some of that \npressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency, both Democrats, \nand Mr. H,bert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night.\n\nThe split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether \nthe president will seek to replace Mr. H,bert as chairman in coming weeks. \nMr. Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the \ncommission, including Pat Wood, a longtime ally of the president who served \nas chief electricity regulator in Texas. Industry executives say they expect \nthat Mr. Bush will eventually name Mr. Wood to the commission\'s top post.\n\nIn a reflection of how delicate the issue is, Mr. H,bert argued that the \nagency\'s action did not amount to imposing price caps. But his position \nappeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost- based \nelectricity regulation (as some Californians favor) and the agency\'s decision \nto impose tactical price controls.\n\nAmong California officials, the dominant reaction was disappointment. Some \nstate regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing \nupside-down economics: it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of \nsevere scarcity, when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage \ncompanies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity.\n\nThe agency, its critics argue, has chosen to ignore price abuses during times \nof relative abundance, when power generators, the critics say, have used \nartificial market power to earn high profits.\n\n"They got it exactly wrong," said Frank Wolak, chief market supervisor for \nthe California Independent System Operator, which runs the state\'s power \ngrid. "It looks like they\'re doing something, but it doesn\'t work in real \ntime."\n\nMr. Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year * in \namounts that he puts in the billions of dollars * occurred when electricity \nsupplies were not acutely short, meaning that the agency\'s price caps would \nhave had no mitigating effect.\n\nThe state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer. But, Mr. \nWolak said, generating companies have become adept at "gaming" the system. He \npredicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in \nCalifornia.\n\nOne fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to \naffiliates out of state. When California\'s transmission grid managers \nscramble to find supplies, the same companies will offer to sell the power \nback to the state, but only above the cap price. The agency\'s new order \nincludes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse, known \nas megawatt laundering. But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such \nmandates, and California officials are skeptical.\n\nThe order also came under fire on other grounds. The commission said that \nprice caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link \nits transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region, a priority \nof the agency that state officials have resisted.\n\nLinda Stuntz, an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the \nagency, called that clause bizarre, arguing that it held the entire \nCalifornia market hostage to a technical filing requirement.\n\nCalifornia politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were \ncarried out as promised, relief would be too limited.\n\nThe price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of \nthe least efficient generating plant in the state.

She characterized the RTO \nfiling requirement as "bizarre".  It appears to me that it is typical FERC \nbehavior; FERC likes to use whatever leverage it has to force compliance.\n\n\nApril 27, 2001\n\nPlan on California Energy Has No Shortage of Critics\nBy JOSEPH KAHN\n\nWASHINGTON, April 26 * A novel plan by federal regulators to control \nCalifornia\'s runaway electricity prices is a messy, politically motivated \ncompromise that may offer some relief to consumers but will do little to fix \nthe state\'s dysfunctional energy market, analysts said today.\n\nThe intervention, announced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on \nWednesday night after much haggling, was dismissed by a wide range of critics \ntoday as a flawed effort that satisfies no one.\n\nIt fell short of the sweeping suspension of regional electricity deregulation \nthat California officials and some energy experts had advocated. But it also \ncrossed what has become a firm ideological line among Republican leaders, \nincluding President Bush, by imposing price controls on some electricity \nsales to utilities.\n\nUnder the agency\'s order, which takes effect on May 1, California regulators \ncan begin to impose price controls on power generators when electricity \nsupplies fall to within 7.5 percent of consumer demand. The state is expected \nto face such shortages routinely this summer, and the order has the potential \nto shave billions of dollars off California\'s electricity bill if implemented \nfully, some people at the federal agency say.\n\n"The president has a long-held belief that price caps don\'t work," the White \nHouse press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said today. "The last thing you want to \ndo is create artificially increased demand and put in disincentives that harm \nthe availability of supply."\n\nMr. Fleischer noted that the energy commission is an independent federal \nagency, adding that the Bush administration has no authority to countermand \nits orders.\n\nBut Mr. Bush did appoint the commission\'s chairman, Curtis L. H,bert Jr., a \nRepublican. Like the president, Mr. H,bert has often insisted that price caps \ndo no good. But he came under withering political pressure to abandon the \nagency\'s largely hands- off approach to the California crisis. Some of that \npressure came from the two other commissioners at the agency, both Democrats, \nand Mr. H,bert wound up voting for the controls adopted on Wednesday night.\n\nThe split with the Bush administration raises fresh questions about whether \nthe president will seek to replace Mr. H,bert as chairman in coming weeks. \nMr. Bush has nominated two Republicans to fill vacant slots on the \ncommission, including Pat Wood, a longtime ally of the president who served \nas chief electricity regulator in Texas. Industry executives say they expect \nthat Mr. Bush will eventually name Mr. Wood to the commission\'s top post.\n\nIn a reflection of how delicate the issue is, Mr. H,bert argued that the \nagency\'s action did not amount to imposing price caps. But his position \nappeared to rest on a semantic distinction between returning to cost- based \nelectricity regulation (as some Californians favor) and the agency\'s decision \nto impose tactical price controls.\n\nAmong California officials, the dominant reaction was disappointment. Some \nstate regulators and market experts said the agency was practicing \nupside-down economics: it has chosen to impose price limits during periods of \nsevere scarcity, when prices theoretically ought to rise to encourage \ncompanies to build power plants and encourage people to use less electricity.\n\nThe agency, its critics argue, has chosen to ignore price abuses during times \nof relative abundance, when power generators, the critics say, have used \nartificial market power to earn high profits.\n\n"They got it exactly wrong," said Frank Wolak, chief market supervisor for \nthe California Independent System Operator, which runs the state\'s power \ngrid. "It looks like they\'re doing something, but it doesn\'t work in real \ntime."\n\nMr. Wolak has estimated that most overcharges by generators last year * in \namounts that he puts in the billions of dollars * occurred when electricity \nsupplies were not acutely short, meaning that the agency\'s price caps would \nhave had no mitigating effect.\n\nThe state is likely to face many emergency shortages this summer. But, Mr. \nWolak said, generating companies have become adept at "gaming" the system. He \npredicted that they would find ways to continue to earn high profits in \nCalifornia.\n\nOne fear is that generating companies will arrange to sell their output to \naffiliates out of state. When California\'s transmission grid managers \nscramble to find supplies, the same companies will offer to sell the power \nback to the state, but only above the cap price. The agency\'s new order \nincludes a provision that is intended to discourage this sort of abuse, known \nas megawatt laundering. But the agency has a weak record of enforcing such \nmandates, and California officials are skeptical.\n\nThe order also came under fire on other grounds. The commission said that \nprice caps would be canceled unless California submitted a proposal to link \nits transmission grid to the one that serves the Western region, a priority \nof the agency that state officials have resisted.\n\nLinda Stuntz, an electricity industry lobbyist who is an expert on the \nagency, called that clause bizarre, arguing that it held the entire \nCalifornia market hostage to a technical filing requirement.\n\nCalifornia politicians said they worried that even if the price caps were \ncarried out as promised, relief would be too limited.\n\nThe price limits will be based on estimates of the highest operating costs of \nthe least efficient generating plant in the state. The order as written means \nthat companies that operate efficient generating plants could still sell \npower at large mark-ups during periods when caps are imposed. When the agency \nscrutinized the California market earlier this year, it found the high-cost \ngenerators to be justified in charging about $300 a megawatt hour for \nelectricity, a price that is about 10 times as high as the state was paying \nfor power a year ago.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2001 The New York Times Company',
